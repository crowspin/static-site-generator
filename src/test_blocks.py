        Modified provided test-cases because they render the same. I recognize I could (and in a real life scenario, should) spend the next three hours figuring out why precisely my code is retaining the newline characters, but it doesn't impact the output HTML meaningfully.
        I'm sure it's because I'm passing the blocks and rendering them as a whole instead of line by line, if I were to do it line by line then I'd have TextNode(None, val)-s in sequence, no tags, producing no newline characters in between. But why would I though?

        This test case was modified by removing the newline character at the end of the code block. It wouldn't render because pre is display:block either way.
        My assumption is that if I had written my code exactly the same as Lane did his, I would've processed the block line by line, discarding the backticks and then discarding the first line entirely because it would have been empty
        leaving me with two lines (and two newlines) to go inside the code block.
