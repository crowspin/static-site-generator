## Static Site Generator

Part of the Boot.dev curriculum. I just wanted to say that having forgotten that this was on the course list, I had planned on making "building my homepage with some extra goodies" my "First Personal Project."
Calling it first would be a bit silly, being that I've been at this since highschool, but I'm gonna pull and rewrite some pieces of other projects I've done before, and write some new stuff to go with it. And yes it'll be mostly backend. It just won't be Python or C.

To launch Python Webhost:  
` python3 -m http.server <port> `
